TARGET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE = """Dear Charlie,

We're writing to invite you and your children Moe and Curly to participate in the study "The Most Fake Study Ever" on Lookit! This study is run by the ECCL at MIT.

More details about the study...

Who: Children who have stopped believing in Santa in the past 6 months.

What happens: How fast can your child hand-compute integrals?

Why: We are interested in seeing how fast your child can hand-compute integrals.

Compensation: You child will receive exactly $1 for each integral computed.

You and your child can participate any time you want by going to "The Most Fake Study Ever" on Lookit ({base_url}/studies/{study_uuid}/). If you have any questions, please reply to this email to reach the ECCL at faker@fakelab.com.

Thanks for contributing to the science of how kids learn - we hope to see you soon!

-- the Lookit team
